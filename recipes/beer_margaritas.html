    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It's beerita time! Who would believe that beer would be the perfect solution to eradicating fluorescent green margaritas? 
        Well, it is. Best to use not-so-micro brews to avoid an overpowering beer flavor. 
        Use the limeade can to measure the ingredients, and adjust with extra water if the mixture seems too sweet. 
        Straining the pulp is always a good idea unless, of course, you like pulp.
